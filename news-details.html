     Anupam Kher breaks down, wipes away tears at best friend Satish Kaushik's funeral
     In a rather shocking update, celebrated actor-director Satish Kaushik passed away 
     on March 9. His best friend Anupam Kher was the first one to break the news and
     Anil Kapoor chose  to stay silent for the longest time until he bid an emotional
     farewell to the actor on Twitter.
     Anupam attended Satish Kaushik's last rites and broke down while paying his tribute.
